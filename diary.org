  Got up at 06:00 AM. I am thinking about why I don't feel like doing anything. My logic is that while I might feel like being productive some of the time, I will revert back to feeling unproductive with a mental block to doing anything. Therefore there is no point in getting things done or starting anything new because eventually the mental block will come up and I will stop moving forward.
  07:38 - Am i curious to see what I could achieve if used my abilities to its maximum.
