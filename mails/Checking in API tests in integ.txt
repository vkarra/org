Subject:	Checking in API tests in integ

Hello Guys,

While checking in new API tests or changes to existing ones in integ (irrespective of whether you do a 
batch processing or not), please let the Scrum Lead know of the checkins.
It’s not the Scrum lead, but you who would make sure that the tests pass in integ.

Also, when the same tests are merged into another branch, the Scrum Lead will get in touch with you if 
they fail, and it will be the responsibility of the author of the test to fix them


Regards,
Vivek.
