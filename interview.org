** API Testing
*** Main challenges
    + Parameter selection
    + Parameter combination
    + Call sequencing
     
*** Test cases based on 
    + Return value based on input condition
    + Does not return anything
    + Trigger some other API/event/interrupt
    + Update data structure
    + Modify certain resources
*** Best Practices: API Testing
**** Planning
     + think about what you will test and how you will be performing the test
     + Depending on complexity of task create test-specification or design document and have it peer reviewed
**** Organization
     + Each test case should be self-contained and isolated from dependencies as possible, implies that test cases should be as simple as possible
     + test cases should be grouped by category, straight-line cases, boundary cases, null inputs and so forth
     + avoid test chaining
**** Priorities
     + avoid jumping into invalid or "evil" tests that will cause crashes and other interesting problems
     + What are the conditions under which the API will be exercised the most(parameters,etc); test these effectively     

*** Difference between api and unit testing
    + unit testing is done by developers, api by qa
    + unit testing typically exercises the smallest unit of code, api testing exercises larger functionality
    + api testing should consider the various alternative scenarios in which the code can be called by the end user
    + api testing is more extensive and consider the interaction between various modules within the application
