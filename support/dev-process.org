** Creating/modifying a test
   1. Create changelist(do not submit)
   2. Create a job in perforce that contains the tests in that changelist
   3. Create a JIRA task and refer to the job
   4. Provide above information to scrum lead on every checkin[refer:[[file:~/org/mails/Checking%20in%20API%20tests%20in%20integ.txt][mail]]]
   5. Use crucible to review
** Perforce structure

*** //team/8r5sp2-in : 8.5 sp2 india development happens here
*** //team/8r5sp3-in : 8.5 sp3 india development happens here
