** Goal
   + Create a code coverage report to provide insights into product areas that do not have enough test coverage
     
** Code Coverage Tools
   + Partcover
   + NCover
   + Visual Studio

** Why stick to visual studio code coverage(no license required)
   + Selected tool should provide coverage information on both managed and unmanaged code
   + Stand-alone profiler available as a free download from Microsoft

** How to setup a run
   + Instrument dlls using vsinstr and start coverage monitor
   + Run the tests
   + Stop coverage monitor
   + .coverage file is produced as output

** Reporting
   + Should provide coverage information upto method/line level
   + Static reports used to maintain coverage snapshots for every milestone
   + Report should be custom since VSTS is not being used

** How is report generated - tools used to generate the report
   + Report modelled after EMMA coverage report
   + NVelocity template engine used with emma template
   + VSCover90.dll provides the necessary functions to extract information from the coverage output

** Report - sample report

** Report - against MR8

** Report - against MR9
